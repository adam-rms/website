# Asset Import
To enable the bulk import of assets, AdamRMS supports the import of assets from a CSV file. This is done as a server Admin function and so can only be done by an AdamRMS server administrator.  
To import assets to the AdamRMS hosted server, please contact [support@adam-rms.com](mailto:support@adam-rms.com) with your completed csv file and Business name.

A template is available with the correct CSV headings, which can be downloaded here: [Asset Import Template](https://dash.adam-rms.com/public/templates/asset-import-template.csv).

The columns of the CSV file are as follows:
