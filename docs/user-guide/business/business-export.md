# Business Export
AdamRMS has a customisable export feature that allows you to be selective about what data you export from the platform. All exports are based on a base export table, and can join with any relevant table for that base table.

The Export page will change depending on what you want to export, and what other tables are associated with your base export table. Therefore, the final export buttons, which allow you to select a file format for the export, will only appear once you have selected a base table, at least one export column and a column to sort the results by. 

## Export Overview
---
The export overview panel summarises what your export will contain and is split into four sections. They are:
 - Base Table -> the table your export is based on
 - Columns -> a list of table columns that will be included in the export
 - Sorting -> how the results will be sorted
 - Joined Tables -> any linked tables to your base table that are included in the export.
