This documentation is intended for developers only.

Thank you for your interest in developing AdamRMS - we're excited to have you contribute to the project and we're looking forward to working with you. These pages will hopefully serve as a useful guide for how to get involved in the project, and how to develop it.

This section of the site contains a huge wealth of information, separated into sections.

## Versions

AdamRMS has two main versions - v1 is still in active development, but most efforts have moved to the v2 repo.
