# Configuration Menu

The configuration menu is where you can set up the core settings of your AdamRMS instance. This includes setting up the database, configuring the email server, and setting up the storage for images and files.

You can find it by clicking configuration at the bottom of the menu on the left of the screen:

:::info
Can't find the configuration menu? If the menu does not appear, your account does not have the correct permissions to access it - you must set your account as a server administrator.
If you are the server owner, you can do this by going to the server settings and adding your account as a server administrator.
