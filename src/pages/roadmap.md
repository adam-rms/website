# The AdamRMS Roadmap

This roadmap sets out the plans and direction of the AdamRMS Project.

Feel free to [edit this page](https://github.com/adam-rms/website/edit/main/src/pages/roadmap.md) by opening a PR, it's very much a living breathing document and we welcome contributions.

## Objectives

- For some, it's a daily driver - it must perform well for those who use it regularly and offer good functionality for power users. For others, it's used rarely, so by default is should offer simple, uniform and intuitive UI interactions.
- Performance trumps functionality.
- It's a product, not a project. Features should only be added where there is a good reason to do so and should serve the user need.
- It should be most usable on devices that users most commonly use.

## Current Status

The hosted solution will continue to be offered to existing customers, with new customers encouraged to self-host the project.

New features will be added to the project as and when they are needed, and will be prioritised by the community. The main objective as it stands is to improve the self-hosting experience and make it easier for new users to self-host AdamRMS.
